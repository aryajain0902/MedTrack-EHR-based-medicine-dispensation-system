# MedTrack — Medicine Purchase Tracking System

## Overview

MedTrack is a healthcare analytics platform developed to ensure transparent, traceable, and data-driven monitoring of medicine purchases across verified pharmacies. The system assigns unique MDT IDs to patients through Aadhaar-based KYC (non-biometric), allowing verified tracking of transactions from prescription generation to medicine dispensation.

As the project lead, I managed a five-member team, overseeing all stages from system planning and backend development to data analytics and dashboard integration. I ensured data accuracy, milestone completion, and effective coordination between technical and analytical contributors.
